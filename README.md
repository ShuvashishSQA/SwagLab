# SwagLab

## Overview
Swaglab is a dummy ecommerce website for testing. In this project, I covered a purchasing journey by picking the first product of the list (with the lowest price tag priority). Script will open the Swaglab with given URL, log into the site with username and password collected dynamically from the UI.

### Covered Test cases are,

1. User will log in by valid cradentials(dynamically collected from the screen)
2. Product list will appear where roduct list be filtered by the criteria named **Price low to high**
3. First item will be picked and redirecting to detail page
4. Adding item into cart and then removing it again. Going back to Product list to ckeck if filterated result still effective.
5. Adding item into cart again from the list.
6. Proceed into checkout
7. Click **Finish** and verify if purchase journey is completed successfully.

From the PRODUCT page, product list will be sorted by Lowest to Higest price priority. First product of that list will be added to the cart and then proceed to cart to checkout journey.

Finally, it will be confirmed by checking success page content and elements.

Thanks.
